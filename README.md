# Intro

self-build is a simple build server currently focused on simplicity and easy setup, its main goal is to enable a continues build by just running:

```bash
$ lein self-build
```

Right from within a lein project thus saving us from the need to setup Jenkins or other more complex solutions.

self-build will support only Git as SCM.
